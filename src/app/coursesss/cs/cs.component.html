                    In the Introduction to HTML module, we covered what HTML is and how it is used to mark up documents. These documents
                    will be readable in a web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs break onto a new line and
                    have space between them. Links are colored and underlined to distinguish them from the rest of the text. What you 
                    are seeing are the browser's default styles — very basic styles — that the browser applies to HTML to make sure 
                    that the page will be basically readable even if no explicit styling is specified by the author of the page.
