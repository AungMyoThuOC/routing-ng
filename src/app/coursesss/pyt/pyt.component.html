                    Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level
                    built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid
                    Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components 
                    together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program
                    maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python 
                    interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major 
                    platforms, and can be freely distributed.
