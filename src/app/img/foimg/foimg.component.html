            <h5>Developer <span>& Desginer</span></h5>
            <p>
                Satoru Gojo (五ご条じょう悟さとる Gojō Satoru?) is one of the main protagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is a special grade 
                jujutsu sorcerer and widely recognized as the strongest in the world. Satoru is the pride of the Gojo Family, the first person to
                inherit both the Limitless and the Six Eyes in four hundred years. He works as a teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High and uses his 
                influence to protect and train strong young allies.
                Satoru is a tall man with a lean build in his later twenties who is considered relatively attractive, mainly due to his facial 
                features. He has snow-white hair and the Six Eyes, which are a vibrant blue color. Satoru normally covers his eyes with a black 
                blindfold which props up his hair and gives it a spikier appearance. When sporting a more casual look, Satoru will wear sunglasses 
                and let his hair down to reach the base of his neck.
