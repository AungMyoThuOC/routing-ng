                Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his 
                village. The story is told in two parts – the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The 
                series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in 
                Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).
                Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's magazine, Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1999 to 2014, and released in tankōbon (book) form
                in 72 volumes. The manga was adapted into an anime television series produced by Pierrot and Aniplex, which broadcast 
                220 episodes in Japan from 2002 to 2007; the English dub of the series aired on Cartoon Network and YTV from 2005 to
                2009. Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to the original series, premiered in Japan in 2007, and ended in 2017, after 500 
                episodes.
